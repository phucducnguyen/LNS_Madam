LNS-Madam is a project that implements low-precision training techniques using the Logarithmic Number System (LNS) with a focus on the multiplicative weight update mechanism. This implementation leverages Vitis HLS (High-Level Synthesis) to optimize the training process for hardware acceleration. Inspired by the research outlined in LNS-Madam: Low-Precision Training in Logarithmic Number System using Multiplicative Weight Update, this project aims to enhance computational efficiency and reduce resource utilization for deep learning models.
